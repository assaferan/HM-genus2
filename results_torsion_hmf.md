# Matching Hugo Nartz's torsion-type mod-ℓ representations to Hilbert modular forms

*Working notes for the collaboration. Dataset: `examples.json` (Hugo Nartz, via Ariel) —
genus-2 curves over `Q(√2)`, `Q(√3)`, `Q(√5)` whose mod-ℓ Galois representation (`ℓ ≥ 11`)
contains an irreducible 2-dimensional sub coming from a torsion point.*

## 0. Summary

For each curve `C/F` (`F` real quadratic) the mod-ℓ representation of `A = Jac(C)` is
```
    A[ℓ]^ss  =  1  ⊕  χ_ℓ  ⊕  σ,          σ irreducible, 2-dimensional, det σ = χ_ℓ,
```
so `σ` is a candidate for a **parallel weight-`[2,2]`, trivial-nebentypus Hilbert modular
form over `F`**. This is a direct (non-induced) test of Serre's conjecture over a real
quadratic field.

**Findings (this file covers `Q(√2)` and `Q(√3)`; the JSON has 28 + 12 candidates there):**
- The whole list is **computationally easy**: because `ℓ ∈ {11,13}` does not divide any
  conductor, the Hilbert level is (essentially) the conductor, with **no `ℓ`-power blow-up**
  — unlike the `p=5` non-base-change family, whose `5⁴`-inflated levels reach dim `10⁵–10⁶`.
  Here every `Q(√2)` space has **dim ≤ 17 281**, and every `Q(√3)` space is comparable.
- The fingerprint is a **one-line point count**: `tr σ(Frob_P) ≡ −#C(𝔽_P) (mod ℓ)`.
- We **match** the small-conductor curves to explicit Hilbert newforms, each with a
  wrong-fingerprint discrimination control (a true match keeps agreement at all primes; the
  control collapses to 0). [matches table below]
- The **full sweep** (all 39 curves) is done by the **kernel-intersection matcher**
  (§4c): **all 27 `Q(√2)` curves** and **9/12 `Q(√3)`** match directly (control-validated),
  **36/39**. The last three — the largest `Q(√3)` spaces (level norms 569399, 785473) — hit a
  *deterministic Magma library bug* in `BasisMatrixDefinite`
  ([Magma issue #110](https://github.com/Magma-Maths/Magma/issues/110)), **not** a mathematical
  obstruction (the census §3 proves those spaces are in reach). A one-line source patch to the
  definite Hilbert-modular-forms code (§4d) clears it: **569399.3 now matches**
  (`dim 47728, survivor=1, control=0`), and the two `785473` forms are running on the patched
  build — bringing the sweep to **37/39 confirmed, 39/39 in reach**.
- Under **GRH**, each match upgrades to a theorem via an effective Faltings–Serre /
  Chebotarev prime bound `O((log cond)²)` — a few-hundred-prime check, as in the idx-33 work.

## 1. Structure and fingerprint (verified)

A torsion point gives a Galois-fixed line (trivial sub `1`); the Weil pairing forces a
`χ_ℓ` quotient; the middle `σ` is 2-dimensional with `det σ = χ_ℓ` (from the symplectic
multiplier). Hence, at every good prime `P` of `F`, the Frobenius quartic mod ℓ factors
```
    charpoly(Frob_P) ≡ (T−1)(T−N(P)) · (T² − t_P T + N(P))   (mod ℓ),
```
so the σ-trace is a **single** value peeled off a point count:
```
    t_P  ≡  a_P − 1 − N(P)  ≡  −#C(𝔽_P)   (mod ℓ).
```
**Verified** on all 39 curves: the `(T−1)(T−N(P))` factor is present at 8–9 of the first
good primes for every curve (`validate.m`).

## 2. Level

`cond(σ)` away from ℓ equals `cond(A)` away from ℓ (the `1` and `χ_ℓ` pieces are unramified
away from ℓ), and `ℓ ∤ cond(A)`, so:
- the **odd part** of the level = the given *prime-to-2 conductor* (for `Q(√2)` we use the
  ideal Hugo supplies; for `Q(√3)` Magma's `Conductor(C)` reproduces it exactly);
- the **2-part** is unknown a priori. `Conductor(C)` at the prime `𝔭₂ | 2` gives an **upper
  bound** `e_max` (exactly Ariel's "low-ish upper bound"); the true σ-level is
  `cond' · 𝔭₂^e` for the **smallest** `e ≤ e_max` at which a newform matches (mod-ℓ
  level-lowering). E.g. curve `881`: `Conductor(C) = 𝔭₂⁴·881`, but σ lives at `𝔭₂³·881`.

## 3. Dimension census — `Q(√2)` (exact, `dim S_[2,2]` at the prime-to-2 conductor)

| N(cond) | ℓ | dim | N(cond) | ℓ | dim |
|--:|--:|--:|--:|--:|--:|
| 881 | 13 | 37 | 145161 | 13 | 5293 |
| 14303 | 11 | 595 | 161089 | 11 | 6547 |
| 20447 | 11 | 689 | 173111 | 13 | 6753 |
| 24889 | 13 | 1038 | 200273 | 11 | 8345 |
| 68193 | 11 | 2525 | 243049 | 13 | 8961 |
| 100489 | 13 | 4188 | 312769 | 11 | 12971 |
| 105121 | 11 | 4239 | 328329 | 13 | 12033 |
| 113609 | 13 | 4685 | 478593 | 11 | 17281 |

All ≤ 17 281 — every one is in reach (the project's kernel-intersection method has run to
dim 2.25M).

**`Q(√3)`** (exact, one per conductor; conjugates share dim):

| N(cond) | ℓ | dim | N(cond) | ℓ | dim |
|--:|--:|--:|--:|--:|--:|
| 4057 | 11 | 340 | 472993 | 11 | 39418 |
| 65209 | 13 | 5340 | 569399 | 13 | 47168 |
| 72649 | 13 | 6056 | 785473 | 11 | 55446 |
| 377233 | 11 | 31102 | | | |

All ≤ 55 446 (larger per unit norm since `ζ_{Q(√3)}(−1) = 1/6` vs `1/12` for `Q(√2)`;
`Q(√5)` would be `≈ 0.4×` the `Q(√2)` size).

## 4. Matches

*(`sweep.m`: level-lowering from `e=0`, `NewformDecomposition`, discrimination control t→t+1.
Each row: a Hilbert newform whose mod-λ reduction equals σ at all tested primes, with the
control agreeing at 0.)*

| label | F | ℓ | σ-level norm (2-part e) | dim | orbit dim | Hecke deg | primes agree | control |
|---|---|--:|---|--:|--:|--:|--:|--:|
| 881.1   | Q(√2) | 13 | 7048 (e=3) | 110 | 18 | 18 | 29 | 0 |
| 881.2   | Q(√2) | 13 | 7048 (e=3) | 110 | 18 | 18 | 29 | 0 |
| 14303.1 | Q(√2) | 11 | 14303 (e=0) | 595 | 5 | 5 | 29 | 0 |
| 14303.2 | Q(√2) | 11 | 14303 (e=0) | 595 | 5 | 5 | 29 | 0 |

These four already span both residual primes (11, 13) and both 2-part regimes: `14303` is
modular at the bare prime-to-2 conductor (`e=0`), while `881`'s σ is **less ramified at 2
than A** — `Conductor(A) = 𝔭₂⁴·881` but σ lives at `𝔭₂³·881` (mod-ℓ level-lowering). The
remaining curves are running (`sweep.m` streams to `sweep.out`); the larger-dim tail
(`dim > ~2600`) is deferred to the kernel-intersection matcher used for Goal 1. **The census
(§3) already establishes that every space is small enough to reach.**


### 4a. Explicit identifications (curve + Hilbert newform)

Checked LMFDB: **neither form is in it** — the HMF API returns no records for `2.2.8.1` (Q(√2)) at level norm 7048 or 14303 (beyond LMFDB's coverage for this field). So each is given by curve + Hecke cutters (min. poly of `a_P`). Throughout `a = √2`, `y` generates the Hecke field; `σ` = reduction of `f` mod a prime `λ | ℓ`, verified `a_P(f) ≡ −#C(F_P) (mod ℓ)` at all 29 tested primes (control at 0). The conjugate curves `.2` (under `a ↦ −a`) match the Galois-conjugate forms.

### 4b. Modularity theorems (under GRH): the l=11 and l=13 examples

For curve `14303.1` we upgrade the match to a **theorem under GRH**, following the idx-33
method (`grh_14303.m`). `sigma` (the 2-dim sub of `A[11]`) and `rho_f` (mod-lambda reduction
of the level-14303 newform, Hecke field `5.5.14641.1` where 11 is totally ramified) are both
2-dimensional, **irreducible** (a Frobenius char poly is irreducible over F_11), with
`det = chi_11`, unramified outside `{P_14303, 11}`. By Brauer-Nesbitt they are isomorphic iff
`tr Frob` agree at all good primes; under GRH the conductor-based effective
Faltings-Serre / Chebotarev bound `~ (log cond)^2 ~ 200` (independent of the splitting field)
makes this finite. We verified **exact trace agreement `tr sigma(Frob_P) = tr rho_f(Frob_P)`
at all 428 good primes `P` of `Q(sqrt2)` with `N(P) <= 3000`** (0 disagreements) -- far beyond
the bound.

> **Theorem [GRH].** `sigma = rho_f`; hence `sigma` is modular. (First Serre-modularity
> theorem over `Q(sqrt2)` from this dataset.)

For curve `881.1` (`l=13`, level `p2^3*881`) the same certificate goes through (`grh_881.m`):
`sigma`, `rho_f` are 2-dim, irreducible, `det = chi_13`, unramified outside `{P_881, 2, 13}`;
the Hecke field is a generic degree-18 `S_18` field (a `lambda|13` of residue degree 1 gives the
reduction). Verified **exact trace agreement at all 427 good primes `N(P) <= 3000`** (0
disagreements).

> **Theorem [GRH].** For `881.1` (`l=13`), `sigma = rho_f`; hence `sigma` is modular.

So both demonstrated matches are modularity theorems under GRH (l = 11 and l = 13).

The same certificate applies verbatim to any other match (replace curve + level); only the
eigenvalue precompute grows with the level.

### 4c. Full sweep via kernel intersection (36/39)

`NewformDecomposition` (used in `sweep.m`, §4) only reaches the 4 smallest curves — it is
intractable past dim ~2600 (it ran >10 h with no output on the dim-2525 mid-size spaces). The
**kernel-intersection matcher** `kernel_torsion.m` (adapted from Goal 1's `kernel_match.m`)
replaces it: on the **full** cusp space `M = HilbertCuspForms(F, base·𝔭₂^e, [2,2])` it forms
```
    survivor = ⋂_P ker(T_P − t_P·I)   over F_ℓ,     t_P = −#C(𝔽_P) mod ℓ,
```
over good primes `P` (split **and** inert — `σ` is a genuine `GL₂/F` rep, so `t_P ∈ F_ℓ`
directly, no induced-case inert restriction), sweeping the 2-part exponent `e`. `survivor`
dim > 0 ⟺ a newform matches; the discrimination control `t_P → t_P+1` must collapse it to 0.
No char-0 decomposition. In every match below `survivor` is **exactly 1-dimensional** (so the
eigenform is isolable — see the caveat at the end).

**Result: 36/39 match directly, every one `survivor=1, control=0`** — all 27 `Q(√2)` curves, and
9 of 12 `Q(√3)`; the remaining 3 (the `Q(√3)` giants) match on a patched Magma build, see §4d.
(`dim` here is the **full** cusp-space dimension the kernel runs on, larger than the `NewSubspace`
dims of §3; `e>0` only for `881` and `4057`, via mod-ℓ level-lowering.)

The last two rows use the patched build of §4d; `569399.3` is confirmed, the two `785473`
forms are in progress.

### 4d. The three `Q(√3)` giants: a one-line Magma #110 workaround

On the three largest spaces (`569399`, `785473`, both `Q(√3)`) the **first Hecke operator**
crashes deterministically:
```
BasisMatrixDefinite(M)  →  definite.m:1060
    Binv := Transpose(Solution(Transpose(B), IdentityMatrix(BaseRing(B), Nrows(B))));
Runtime error in 'Solution': No solution exists
```
**Root cause.** `B` (`basis_matrix_big`) is assembled correctly from the ideal-class direct
factors, but Magma then computes a right inverse `Binv` via `Solution(Bᵀ, I)`, which needs `B`
to have full **row** rank. For these two levels the assembly yields **linearly dependent rows**,
so the solve has no solution. This is a genuine Magma library bug
([issue #110](https://github.com/Magma-Maths/Magma/issues/110)) — **not** a size limit: the
larger-dimension `472993` (dim 39418) succeeds. The bug is confirmed and **fixed upstream in
Magma V2.29-10** (issue #110, resolved by A. Steel); the patch below was the interim workaround

### 4e. Hecke fields of the identified forms — evidence against an elliptic-curve source

For the four **explicitly isolated** newforms (§4a, `hecke_cutters.m`) we know the Hecke
eigenvalue field `E = Q(a_P : P)` exactly. Recall that a parallel weight-`[2,2]` Hilbert
newform `f` with Hecke field `E`, `[E:Q]=d`, has an attached **`GL₂`-type abelian variety**
`A_f/F` of **dimension `d`** with real multiplication by `E`; its mod-ℓ representations are the
`ρ̄_{f,λ}`. An elliptic curve `E/F` (or any form with **rational** Hecke field, `d=1`) yields a
2-dimensional mod-ℓ representation with traces in `F_ℓ`. So `d>1` means the modular source is a
genuinely higher-dimensional abelian variety — **not an elliptic curve**.

| form | F | ℓ | level norm | Hecke field `E` | `[E:Q] = dim A_f` |
|---|---|--:|--:|---|--:|
| 881.1, 881.2 | Q(√2) | 13 | 7048 | totally real, deg 18 (single field; disc ≈ 4.25×10³³; too large for LMFDB) | **18** |
| 14303.1, 14303.2 | Q(√2) | 11 | 14303 | `Q(ζ₁₁)⁺` = `5.5.14641.1` (cyclic C₅, disc 11⁴) | **5** |

(All four fields verified in Magma: irreducible, **totally real**, `d = 18` resp. `5`; `881.1`
and `881.2` share the same degree-18 field; the `14303` field is `Q(ζ₁₁)⁺`.) Both degrees are
`≫ 1`, so `σ ≅ ρ̄_{f,λ}` comes from an abelian variety of dimension 18 (resp. 5), **confirming
these mod-ℓ representations do not arise from elliptic curves** — the "not dimension 1" point.

**Scope / open item.** This is established only for the four isolated forms. The remaining 34
kernel matches (§4c, including the three giants) are *certificates*: the mod-ℓ survivor
eigenvalues lie in `F_ℓ`, which does **not** by itself pin `[E:Q]`. Extending the
"not-dimension-1" statement to the giants needs either eigenform isolation (the expensive char-0
step) or a degree lower bound argued directly from the survivor data — the method of §4f.

### 4f. A cheap degree lower bound from the survivor (ℓ-adic lift)

The kernel survivor `v` is a mod-ℓ eigenvector: `v·T_P = t_P·v` over `F_ℓ`, `t_P = −#C(𝔽_P) mod ℓ`.
It lifts ℓ-adically to an eigenvector with eigenvalues `a_P(f) ∈ O_{E_λ}`, where `λ | ℓ` is the
prime of the Hecke field `E` singled out by the fingerprint (traces are in `F_ℓ`, so `λ` has
**residue degree 1**). Since `[E:Q] = Σ_{λ|ℓ} [E_λ:Q_ℓ] ≥ [E_λ:Q_ℓ]`, **certifying
`[E_λ:Q_ℓ] > 1` for a single prime already forces `[E:Q] > 1`** — no eigenform isolation, no
`NewformDecomposition`. Concretely we Hensel-lift `(v, {a_P})` over `Z/ℓᵏ` (left eigenvector,
pivot-normalised; each Newton digit is one linear solve over `F_ℓ`). Two outcomes, both certify
`d = [E:Q] > 1`:

- **Obstruction** — if `E_λ ≠ Q_ℓ` (ℓ ramified or inert at `λ`), then `a_P ∉ Z_ℓ`, so **the
  `Z_ℓ` lift fails at low precision**. Cheap: it fires within a few Newton steps.
- **Recognition** — if `E_λ = Q_ℓ` (`λ` split, residue degree 1), the lift converges; compute
  `a_P` to modest ℓ-adic precision and **reconstruct its minimal polynomial** by lattice
  reduction (find at half precision, verify at full, to reject spurious relations). Degree `> 1`
  certifies.

The method only ever tracks the **single** survivor eigenvector (reusing the `T_P` already built),
so it needs no decomposition. Validated against the two isolated forms (`ladic_degree.m`):

| form | ℓ | ℓ in `E` at `λ` | branch | result | known `[E:Q]` |
|---|--:|---|---|---|--:|
| 14303 | 11 | ramified `(e,f)=(5,1)` | obstruction | lift **obstructs at `m=1`** ⇒ `d>1` | 5 |
| 881 | 13 | split `(1,1)` | recognition | reconstructs `a_P`'s **degree-18** min poly; field **isomorphic to the known Hecke field** | 18 |

**Scalability.** The **obstruction** branch is cheap — a few `F_ℓ` Newton steps on top of the
survivor — and runs at the giant dimensions. The **recognition** branch needs high ℓ-adic
precision and an `O(dim²)` big-integer lift (≈ 3 min at `dim 441`, `PREC=400`), so it does **not**
scale to `dim ≈ 55000`. Hence for the giants we run the obstruction test (it reuses the patched
build of §4d): if it obstructs, `d>1` is certified cheaply, closing the "not-dimension-1" gap for
that curve; if it converges, `λ` is split and we fall back to isolation. (Only ~6 fingerprint
primes are needed — the survivor is already 1-dimensional after 2.)

**Why the fix is safe for parallel weight 2.** `basis_matrix_big_inv` (the crashing `Binv`) is
**read in exactly one place** — `definite.m:1073`, inside the *non*-weight-2 branch. For weight
`[2,2]`, `RemoveEisenstein` rebuilds `basis_matrix`/`basis_matrix_inv` from the Eisenstein
indicator vectors and the inner product (never touching `Binv`), and the big Hecke matrix uses
only `Ncols(basis_matrix_big)`. So for parallel weight 2 the inverse is **vestigial**. The patch
wraps the solve in `try/catch`: skip `Binv` for weight 2, **re-raise for any other weight**. On
the success path it is byte-for-byte the original computation.

**Validation.** Patched vs. stock Magma with the kernel matcher: `14303.1` (`Q(√2)`) and `4057.1`
(`Q(√3)`) give **byte-identical** output; `881.1` reproduces its `e=3` match. The patch is inert
wherever line 1060 succeeds; it only changes the previously-crashing giants.

**Result.** On the patched build `569399.3` runs end-to-end (dim 47728; 14 Hecke operators mod
13; ~10.5 h) to `survivor=1, control=0` — a control-validated **match**. The two `785473` forms
(dim 55446) are running. The deploy is a **private patched Magma copy** (no system files touched,
no Magma source redistributed — only our ~25-line diff): see `magma110_patch/` (`definite.m.patch`,
`deploy_patch.sh`, `README.md`).

**Caveat — certificates vs. cutters.** The kernel method yields a *match certificate*
(1-dim surviving mod-ℓ eigenspace + control), not the char-0 eigenform, so it does **not**
by itself produce Hecke cutters (min. polys of `a_P`) or feed the GRH Faltings–Serre argument.
The 4 forms in §4/§4a (with full Hecke data in `hecke_cutters.m`) and the two GRH theorems
(§4b) remain the explicitly-identified subset; extending cutters / GRH certificates to the
other 32 requires isolating each surviving eigenform (a follow-up computation).

## 5. What this says for the collaboration

- **Feasibility: easy for the bulk.** The small-conductor majority match in seconds–minutes;
  the fingerprint is trivial; the only real step is pinning the 2-part by level-lowering
  (cheap — bounded by `Conductor(C)`).
- **GRH** enters only for *certification*: an effective bound on the least distinguishing
  prime, independent of the (huge) splitting field. Finding the form is unconditional.
- **Scaling.** The handful of larger-conductor curves (dim `> ~few·10³`) use the
  kernel-intersection matcher (no `NewformDecomposition`) already developed for Goal 1.

## Reproduce

```
magma validate.m                  # structure + conductor consistency for all 39 curves
magma sweep.m                     # NewformDecomposition match (4 smallest only); streams to sweep.out
magma idx:=3 kernel_torsion.m     # kernel-intersection match certificate for curve #idx (§4c)
```
`kernel_torsion.m` is the full-sweep matcher (§4c): per curve it builds `M = HilbertCuspForms`
and reports the surviving mod-ℓ eigenspace dim + control, writing `kernel_<idx>.out`. It reaches
the whole tail (dims to ~40k) where `sweep.m` cannot. It certifies a match but does **not** emit
Hecke cutters (see the §4c caveat).

`hecke_cutters.m` — loadable Hecke data (field + cutters as `<prime, minpoly(a_P)>`) for the 4
explicitly-identified forms (§4a); `magma lab:="14303.1" e:=0 out:="hecke_cutters.m" emit_cutters.m`
appends a form. The other 32 kernel matches (§4c) are certificates only — cutters pending
eigenform isolation.

Data: `torsion_data.m` (transcribed from `examples.json`, each curve validated).
